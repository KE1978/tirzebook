# Tirzebook

**Tirzebook is a protocol and a manifesto in book form.**

Twelve weeks. Every day documented – protocol, dosing, reflections.  
This project is a raw self-experiment: discipline, numbers, and real-time logging from the inside.

Not a diet book – a system and a blueprint for serious change.  
Built on GLP-1, lived in real time. No filter.
